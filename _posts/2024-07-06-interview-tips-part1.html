    <p><b>How do you handle rejection or setbacks during the job search process, and what keeps you motivated?</b></p>
    <p>Rejections are always hard to digest, but it's important to understand that you're not alone—everyone faces them. Sometimes we might not get shortlisted, or we might struggle in an interview. However, I see every interview as an opportunity to learn. Even if it's challenging, I go in with the mindset that I'll gain something from the experience, such as understanding the types of questions asked and overcoming my anxiety. Practice makes perfect, and even rejections contribute to that perfection by providing valuable experience. We need to believe in ourselves, have clear goals, and always look ahead. This mindset helps me stay positive. Negative thoughts can be replaced with positive ones, and failures or rejections make us stronger compared to having no opportunities at all.</p>
      
    <p><b>Can you describe a challenging technical interview you faced and how you approached it?</b></p>
    <p>I once had a live coding interview that was quite challenging. Live coding sessions are always tough, and I wasn't expecting it at that stage of the interview, so I wasn't mentally prepared. However, instead of giving up, I engaged with the interviewer to better understand the question and asked clarifying questions. I noticed that the interviewer appreciated our discussion and brainstorming, which made the session more interactive and less tedious for him. Initially, I struggled to make progress, but as we brainstormed, I began to understand the problem better and started generating different solutions. By the end, I had made significant progress—around 80%. At first, I thought I wouldn't make any headway, but communicating with the interviewer and asking questions helped me overcome my stress and think of alternative solutions.</p> 
    
    <p><b>Can you share any unique or unconventional methods youʼve used to stand out to potential employers?</b></p>
    <p>The first step is to get shortlisted. For this, your CV is crucial since it represents you before the interview. Many companies use an Applicant Tracking System ATS to filter CVs. A company called TopCV<a href="#note-1"><sup id="fn1">1.</sup></a> can help. By submitting your CV to them, you can see if it passes through their ATS. If it does, it likely will pass other companies' ATS as well. If not, they provide valuable feedback to improve your CV.</p>
    <p>Once you get an interview, it's essential to research the company thoroughly. Look for specific projects they are working on and mention these in the interview to show you've done your homework. For example, you might say, "I saw that you provide services for Google and Microsoft," which demonstrates your attention to detail and genuine interest in the company. During the interview, especially in behavioral questions, maintaining a positive attitude is crucial. I have received positive feedback for my optimism. 
    Additionally, mentioning volunteer activities can leave a good impression, showing that you are committed to personal growth outside of work as well.</p>

    <p><b>Which resources or tools do you find most helpful when preparing for technical interviews, and how do they enhance your readiness?</b></p>
    <p>Before my interview, I utilized the STAR technique<a href="#note-2"><sup id="fn1">2.</sup></a> and gained valuable experience from mock interviews hosted by Rajani Rao at Women Who Code London. These mock interviews not only equipped me with solid answers but also instilled a sense of calmness within me</p>

    <p><b>Which resources or tools do you find most helpful when preparing for technical interviews, and how do they enhance your readiness</b></p>
    <p>Mock interviews were invaluable to me. Coding Mock interviews<a href="#note-3"><sup id="fn1">3.</sup></a> helped to explain my thought process to others. I gave a lot of paid mock system design interviews<a href="#note-4"><sup id="fn1">4.</sup></a> as well as it is helpful to be familiar with FAANG and Big Tech questions quality before actual interviews.
    </p>

    <p><b>Can you describe a challenging technical interview you faced and how you approached it?</b></p>
    <p>One of the most challenging interviews for me was a system design one. I sat myself through the eyes of my interviewer and prepared with the kind of system they would ask about. During the interview, I did not shy away from showing my knowledge or admitting I am struck when I am. I think it's really important to be yourself and believe in yourself as it helps you to accept the outcome better.
    </p>

    <p><b>How do you handle rejection or setbacks during the job search process, and what keeps you motivated?</b></p>
    <p><b>A good support system is important.</b> My family believed in me and they pushed me towards being better. I always shared my failures with my good friends who pointed out things I could do differently. I remember sharing that I need this job before my interview to my mentor for which he replied ‘it's just a job’.  Resilience builds up as we face failures. Sometimes we need to learn our lessons and forgive our mistakes.</p>
    <p>Sahana’s resources recommendations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For System design <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gkcs" target="_blank"> Gaurav Sen</a> shares very good system design videos which I see myself referring to from time to time.</li>
      <li><a href="https://leetcode.com" target="_blank"> Leetcode</a> practice was very crucial resource for BigTech Interviews</li>
