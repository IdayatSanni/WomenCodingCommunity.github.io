  The one thing ChatGPT will not do is tell you the right questions to ask.

<div class="text-justify">
  <p>As a data scientist, I use ChatGPT daily. It’s great for:</p>
  <div class="pb-3">
    <div>
      <h1 class="section-header">1) Translation</h1>
      <p>I have found ChatGPT to be very helpful at translating languages I am fluent in (English or Python code) into languages that I am less comfortable with (for example, HTML). I recently used ChatGPT to help me write code in Apple’s Script Editor app to automate composing monthly report emails to over 20 client companies. This included looking up a distribution list, adding the cc’s, writing the subject and body of the email, and adding the correct attachment. I was able to do this without learning any of the syntax of Script Editor; rather, I worked with ChatGPT to translate specific requests.    </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1 class="section-header">2) Positivity and confidence</h1>
      <p>As someone who struggles with self-doubt, I’ve found ChatGPT’s <span class="p-quote">“fake it ‘til you make it”</span> confidence refreshing. “Can you write this complicated function in this language”? ChatGPT will always cheerfully output an answer, unbothered by whether it’s correct or not.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1 class="section-header">3) Rubber-ducking</h1>
      <p>You know those times when you spend hours working on a problem by yourself, only to find the answer staring at you 30 seconds into explaining the problem to a colleague? I am currently reading a book called the
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/women-coding-community/events/300856519" target="_blank">Pragmatic Programmer</a>,
        which advises talking to a rubber duck if no human is available. I’ve found ChatGPT to be a rather effective rubber duck.</p>

  <p>I used to work as part of the support team for a financial app, and 80% of my job was knowing how to clarify and rephrase the client’s questions. Knowing how to guide someone from a series of vague generalities down to a specific and narrow issue to be solved is an important skill. Once you have the right question, finding the answer can be trivial.</p>

  <p class="font-weight-bold">So, why do I find ChatGPT helpful?</p>
  <p>Without the burden of reading through vast amounts of documentation to find the syntax for a particular command, I am free to focus on defining the right problem and breaking it into small logical chunks to be solved.</p>
  <p>
    Like the computer in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy who gave 42 as the answer to <span class="p-quote">“life, the universe, and everything”</span>, what you really need to know is <span class="p-quote">“what is the question”?</span>
