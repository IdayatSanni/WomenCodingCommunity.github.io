      <p>
        <span><strong>Research on the Company:</strong></span>
        <span>Understanding the company you are interviewing with is crucial. Research their products, services, culture, and recent news. This information will help you tailor your responses to align with the company’s values and demonstrate your genuine interest in the role. Based on that research, prepare 3-4 questions to ask. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><strong>Glassdoor:</strong></span>
        <span>Using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.glassdoor.com">Glassdoor</a> to research company-specific interview experiences can provide insights into the types of questions asked, the interview process, and the overall candidate experience. This helps in understanding what to expect and tailoring preparation accordingly.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><strong>Recruiter Insights:</strong></span>
        <span>Always asking the recruiter about the interview process can be very beneficial. Recruiters can provide valuable information about the structure of the interviews, the key competencies being assessed, and any specific areas to focus on. This allows for more strategic preparation.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><strong>Leverage Online Resources:</strong></span>
        <span>Utilizing online platforms like <a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com">LeetCode</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a>, and simple system design videos to practice coding challenges and learn new concepts is invaluable. These resources help you improve problem-solving skills and become familiar with the types of questions commonly asked in technical interviews</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><strong>Mock Interviews:</strong></span>
        <span>Conducting mock interviews with a mentor or a friend is incredibly beneficial. This practice helps simulate the interview environment, receive constructive feedback, and work on areas needing improvement. Mock interviews also build confidence and improve the ability to articulate solutions under pressure.

      </p>
      <p>
        <span><strong>Consistent Practice:</strong></span>
        <span>Regular and consistent practice is key to technical interview success. Dedicating time each day to solving coding problems, reviewing algorithms, and practicing system design is essential. This continuous effort helps reinforce knowledge and keeps skills sharp.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><strong>Network and Seek Mentorship:</strong></span>
        <span>Connecting with professionals in the industry through LinkedIn, local meetups, or tech conferences is very beneficial. Seeking mentorship from experienced engineers can provide guidance, advice, and potential job opportunities. Check out our mentors and apply for <a href="/mentors">the ad-hoc session.</a></span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><strong>Practice with Peers:</strong></span>
        <span>Finding friends or peers who are also entering the job market and practicing together is very beneficial.
