  <p>
    In today's fast-paced work environment, career growth isn't something that happens by
    chance—it requires intention and strategy. One of the most effective ways to ensure you're
    advancing in the right direction is by regularly tailoring your career goals, aligning them with
    your evolving aspirations and the needs of your organization. But how do you ensure these
    goals are clear, achievable, and relevant?
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-header">Set Clear Goals</h2>
  <p>
    Set <span class="font-weight-bold">goals</span> for team <span class="font-weight-bold">projects</span> and <span
      class="font-weight-bold">personal growth</span> with a focus on the bigger
    picture for the
    <span class="font-weight-bold">quarter</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">year</span> ahead.
  </p>
  <p>Feedback quarterly will build a quick feedback loop. Prepare the list of your career goals and ask what could be X,
    Y and Z to achieve them. Keep a bigger picture in your head - where do you want to be by the
    end of the year, in the next 5 years?</p>

  <p>Revisit goals, expectations, and progress <span class="font-weight-bold">weekly</span> or <span
      class="font-weight-bold">bi-weekly</span> for clarity and alignment.
    Seeking feedback on your performance. This meeting shouldn’t be limited to a sync on all current projects on your
    plate and their progress: discuss blockers for your career goals, <span class="font-weight-bold">get
      feedback on your progress</span>, highlight what X, Y, and Z to do, and ask for career guidance!</p>

  <h2 class="section-header">Give Candour Feedback</h2>
  <p>Did you have to cut corners by working <span class="font-weight-bold">under pressure</span>? Or they <span
      class="font-weight-bold">didn’t reply</span> in time? Give them <span class="font-weight-bold">candid
      feedback</span> and
    align them with all project problems! Was there a moment when they didn’t give a requirement to unblock the project?
    Or were you or your team asked
    to stay long hours by a pressured deadline? Did you need more time to refactor legacy components to make the
    solution neat and clean? Be ready to give them candid feedback
    and align them with all project problems!</p>

  <h2 class="section-header">Keep a Habit of Documenting Your Achievements</h2>
  <p>Remember to track notes and highlight key points and achievements <span class="font-weight-bold">every
      Friday</span>, scheduling time in your <span class="font-weight-bold">calendar</span> to
    ensure you don't overlook them. It’s so easy to forget how many things you’ve done in 2 weeks! Keep Google Docs or
    any other notes-keeper tool and put the important points and achievements on Friday every week. Block your time in
    your calendar to make sure you won’t forget. Use this document to ask for feedback and always align exceptions!</p>
