                <h2>Our story</h2>
                <p>
                    In the aftermath of the dissolution of one of the largest networks for women in tech in 2024, the
                    women
                    of our London community decided to continue our mission in a new community: to empower all women in
                    the
                    tech space. United by a common goal and fueled by a shared passion, our tight-knit community joined
                    forces, bringing their experience, diverse talents and perspectives to the table.
